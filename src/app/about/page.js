          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Emerging mobility systems, such as connected and automated vehicles
            (CAVs), shared mobility, and electric vehicles, are reshaping the
            future of transportation. These innovations provide unprecedented
            opportunities for enhancing safety and efficiency in transportation
            networks. However, before large-scale deployment, a comprehensive
            evaluation of CAVs is essential, spanning from simulation to
            real-world scenarios.

            , a 1:25 research and educational robotic testbed, to replicate
            real-world urban traffic environments. The testbed enables rapid,
            repeatable experimentation that bridges the gap between simulation
            and real-world applications. Our key research goals include:

            empowering these systems to continuously improve their performance
            by interacting with their environment. Key applications of our work
